// grid cells, each with the PNOA image the model looked at and the
// detections found in it), kept in localStorage so each visitor keeps a
// private record without needing an account (see product spec: no login).
//
// The run's metadata (bounds, detections, classification) always lives in
// localStorage - but each cell's base64 JPEG thumbnail (~40-120KB) is
// offloaded to the backend's analysis_images table first (see
// 007_analysis_images.sql and analysisImagesController.js), and only the
// resulting numeric id is kept here. That's what removed the old MAX_RUNS
// cap this file used to enforce: the thing that actually filled up
// localStorage's few-MB-per-origin quota was the images, not the run
// metadata, so once images live in Postgres instead there's no longer a
// real reason to throw away old runs. The image upload can still fail
// (backend unreachable, e.g. offline demo) - when it does, the raw base64
// is kept embedded in the run exactly like before, so nothing is lost,
// just potentially quota-limited the old way for that one run.
